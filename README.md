## 📖 The Story: Why Pawsport?

Moving across borders is stressful. Moving with a pet? That's a logistical nightmare.

Every year, thousands of pet owners face the daunting task of relocating their furry family members. The process is riddled with:
- 🤯 **Confusing Regulations**: Varying rules for every country, airline, and transit point.
- 📅 **Strict Timelines**: Miss a vaccination window by one day, and your pet can't fly.
- 📄 **Paperwork Overload**: Health certificates, import permits, titer tests... the list never ends.
- 😨 **Anxiety**: The fear of making a mistake that could leave a pet stranded in quarantine is real.

**Pawsport was born to solve this.** We believe that no pet parent should have to navigate this complex maze alone. By combining advanced AI with a supportive community, we turn a stressful relocation into a planned, manageable journey.

## 🏗️ Built With AI

Pawsport is not just an AI product; it's an **AI-native project**. We leveraged cutting-edge generative tools to accelerate every stage of development:

- **👨‍💻 Code Generation**: The codebase was architected and developed with **GitHub Copilot** (powered by **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**). From React components to serverless API functions, Copilot acted as our pair programmer, ensuring modern best practices and rapid iteration.
- **🎥 Video Demo**: Our promotional material and demo videos were generated using **Veo** and edited by **Gemini**, allowing us to visualize the user journey without an expensive production budget.
- **📚 Documentation**: All project documentation, including this README and our API specs, was written and refined with the help of **Copilot** and **Gemini**, ensuring clarity and comprehensive coverage.
